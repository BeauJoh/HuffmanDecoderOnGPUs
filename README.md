# HuffmanDecoderOnGPUs

Huffman encoding provides a simple approach for lossless compression of
sequential data. The length of encoded symbols varies and these symbols are
tightly packed in the compressed data. Thus Huffman decoding is not easily
parallelisable. This is unfortunate since it is desirable to have a parallel
algorithm which scales with the increased core count of modern systems. This
paper presents a parallel approach for decoding Huffman codes which work by
decoding from every location in the bit sequence then concurrently combining
the results into the uncompressed sequence. Although requiring more operations
then serial approaches the presented approach is able to produce results
marginally faster, on sufficiently large data sets, then that of a simple
serial implementation. This is achieved by using the large number of threads
available on modern GPUs. A variety of implementations, primarily OpenCL, are
presented to demonstrate the scaling of this algorithm on CPU and GPU hardware
in response to cores available. As devices with more cores become available the
importance of such an algorithm will increase.

The associated software in this repository is an examination of Huffman
Decoding using parallel methods on GPU and other accelerator architectures, and
is implemented with OpenCL, CUDA and C -- there is also an experimental OpenACC
version.


Compilation
-----------
There are suitable `Makefiles` in each software release. Therefore, `cd` to the
`framework` directory and either `ReleaseCL` for the OpenCL version,
`ReleaseCU` for the CUDA implementation or `ReleaseACC` for the OpenACC version
-- though this is highly unstable. Then run `make`. These `Makefiles` were
generated on one particular machine and with fixed dependency code paths, thus
some modification may be needed to compile on your system.


Datasets
--------
The `files` directory contains the data sets used in our experimental analysis.
Uncompressed files included are the `E.coli`, `bible.txt`, `book2`, `hello`,
`kjv.txt`, `news`, `paper1` and `world192.txt` datasets, these are added to be
used for legitimacy of solution checks.
Such that, the decoded solution of the encoded files should be the same as the
uncompressed files presented here.  The compressed files are therefore all the
corresponding files with a `.huff` extension.


Usage
-----
6 tests are available, namely:
  * kjv
  * hello
  * book2
  * news
  * paper1
  * bigtable
These are the only arguments accepted, sample usage takes the form of:
    ./HuffFramework bigtable
where `bigtable` is one of the provided 6 dataset tests. Note, `bigtable`
actually generates all the results by running through the `kjv`, `hello`,
`book2`, `news` and `paper1`. The final results presented are in milliseconds
(ms) and are the minimum time (the best result) from a sample of 25 runs.
